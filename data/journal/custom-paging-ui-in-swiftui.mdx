SwiftUI 2 introduced a new `TabView` style called `PageTabViewStyle` that enables developers to easily create horizontal Pagers (aka Paging) with dots at the bottom to show users where they are. This is the equivalent of `UIPageViewController` from UIKit.

Today, we will cover how to use the new style for `TabView` and how to create a custom `IndexView` component.

## Getting Started

Using the new API is as simple as setting the new `PageTabViewStyle`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

  // MARK: - Private Properties

  @State private var currentIndex = 0
  private let colors: [Color] = [.red, .blue, .green, .yellow]

  // MARK: - Body

  var body: some View {
    TabView(selection: $currentIndex) {
      ForEach(0..<colors.count, id: \.self) { index in
        colors[index]
          .tag(index)
      }
    }
    .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle(indexDisplayMode: .always))
  }
}
```

Here, I have an array of colors — with each color being a page — and I am also tagging every `Color` view with its desired index. The `TabView` initializer has a `selection` binding that represents the current page.

/>

A couple of things to keep in mind:

1. The paging dots are white and translucent. Therefore, if your background is also white, you won’t see them (tested on iOS/Xcode Beta 3).
2. The contents of the `TabView` cannot be drawn over the safe area insets (Tested on iOS/Xcode Beta 3).

## Creating a Custom IndexView

Now that we have the basics covered, we can quickly create any custom component to represent the current page and update it accordingly with our `currentIndex` state property.

We are going to take a stab at making a more dynamic version of the system dots. This index component will present at most three dots and animate the insertion/removal as you swipe through the pages.

```swift
struct Fancy3DotsIndexView: View {

  // MARK: - Public Properties

  let numberOfPages: Int
  let currentIndex: Int


  // MARK: - Drawing Constants

  private let circleSize: CGFloat = 16
  private let circleSpacing: CGFloat = 12

  private let primaryColor = Color.white
  private let secondaryColor = Color.white.opacity(0.6)

  private let smallScale: CGFloat = 0.6


  // MARK: - Body

  var body: some View {
    HStack(spacing: circleSpacing) {
      ForEach(0..<numberOfPages) { index in // 1
        if shouldShowIndex(index) {
          Circle()
            .fill(currentIndex == index ? primaryColor : secondaryColor) // 2
            .scaleEffect(currentIndex == index ? 1 : smallScale)

            .frame(width: circleSize, height: circleSize)

            .transition(AnyTransition.opacity.combined(with: .scale)) // 3

            .id(index) // 4
        }
      }
    }
  }


  // MARK: - Private Methods

  func shouldShowIndex(_ index: Int) -> Bool {
    ((currentIndex - 1)...(currentIndex + 1)).contains(index)
  }
}
```

That’s quite a bit of code, so let’s go through it step by step:

1. `ForEach` and `shouldShowIndex()` — Display only three dots or less (for the current page and its adjacent pages).
2. `.fill()` and `.scale()` — Apply different styling to showcase which `Circle` is focused.
3. `.transition()` — Animate the insertion and removal of each `Circle` with opacity and scale.
4. `.id(index)` — Create unique `Circle` instances for each index.

## Final Step

Now we just need to update `ContentView` to make use of the new `Fancy3DotsIndexView`:

1. Add an implicit animation for every change that happens to the `currentIndex` binding.
2. Overlay the new `IndexView` component and plug in the necessary properties.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

  // ...

  var body: some View {
    TabView(selection: $currentIndex.animation()) { // 1
      ForEach(0..<colors.count, id: \.self) { index in
        colors[index]
          .tag(index)
      }
    }
    .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle(indexDisplayMode: .always))
    .overlay(Fancy3DotsIndexView(numberOfPages: colors.count, currentIndex: currentIndex)) // 2
  }
}
```

Voilà!

## Conclusion

Making animations in SwiftUI was already insanely easy, and now with the new `TabView` style, you can create any kind of index view! Stay tuned for my upcoming articles!

If you are feeling brave enough, I encourage you to try to make your own animations!
